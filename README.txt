/!\ IMPORTANT /!\

I only worked on the wireframe (with Figma) and the style (with CSS and Bootstrap) on that project.

It was a team work I have done with two collaborators at the end of my training around June 2023. 

It is an example of MVC made by hand. We could have used Symfony but as we were not familiar with the framework, we decided to make it like this. 

It helps understanding what is below some functions from all the frameworks which helps making MVC architecture such as Symfony and Laravel.

I have worked with that kind of framework during my internship.

I can't share the project I have worked on during my internship, but I would be pleased to show it in an interview.
